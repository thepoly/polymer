This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started
 anthony
First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

 if the first line in the content of an article is #photofeature# then don't display that line in a final page. also if this line is present then don't
   use components in @components/Article/ use components in a new components folder inside @components/Article/ called Photofeature. the photofeature article pages don't have the normal red header. they have the special photofeature header with a really small polytechnic logo, white, centered at the top of the screen. also the search icon is white at the top left. the headline is whatever the best contrase color is for the image (defalt to white) centered down at the bottom of the FULLSCREEN image. the header is over this image, and the headline (and subdeck under it) is at the bottom, also over the image. everything is on top of the fullscreen image. make this page work on mobile as well please, just the image will be cropped to be fullscreen mobile. then when you scroll it is no longer the fullscreen image and then it is normal from there.
